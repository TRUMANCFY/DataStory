The Times reported that Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks each had encounters with Trump in which he groped or kissed them without their consent . One of the alleged incidents occurred in 2005 , the other more than 30 years ago .  People Magazine published a report later Wednesday night by one of its writers , Natasha Stoynoff , in which she alleged that she had been physically attacked by Trump at Mar-A-Lago while she was on assignment in December 2005 writing a profile of his first anniversary with his wife , Melania .

Also in the wake of Friday 's leak , one woman who CNN anchor Erin Burnett has known for years told her she had a similar experience with Trump .  The woman -- who asked not to be identified -- met Trump in a boardroom in Trump Tower and another man -- a colleague of Burnett 's friend -- was in the boardroom at the time of the incident .  The woman told Burnett : "" Trump took Tic Tacs , suggested I take them also . He then leaned in , catching me off guard , and kissed me almost on the lips . I was really freaked out . ...

The second presidential debate was Sunday . On Friday , The Washington Post made public a hot-mic recording of Trump from Access Hollywood . On the same day , WikiLeaks began its release of hacked emails from the Clinton campaign , revealing more on Monday through Wednesday .  In the four-way race , Clinton is favored among non-whites ( +62 points ) , suburban women ( +24 ) , women ( +19 ) , and voters under 30 ( +16 ) . Third party candidates hurt her among younger voters , as about one in four of them go for Johnson or Stein .  Trump 's the pick for men ( +5 points ) , whites ( +14 ) , and whites without a college degree ( +25 ) .

Support for Trump among white evangelical Christians held steady at 68 percent . Typically , however , about three-quarters of white evangelicals vote for the GOP nominee . Trump 's support among regular church-goers dropped eight points , from 53 to 45 percent .  Independents split , giving 35 percent to each Clinton and Trump , with another 21 percent backing Johnson or Stein . Trump was up by 12 points among independents in late September .  Eighty-one percent of Democrats back Clinton and 80 percent of Republicans support Trump .  "" If the Republicans are not at rock-bottom , they can certainly see the bottom from where they are , "" says GOP pollster Daron Shaw , who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson . "" If Trump got 90 percent of self-identified Republicans and nothing else -- no Democrats and no independents -- he 'd be at 32 percent .

Clinton is preferred to handle health care despite nearly half wanting to get rid of President Obama 's signature law . Forty-nine percent of registered voters want to repeal Obamacare vs. 45 percent who prefer to keep it in place . That 's a more positive rating for the law than the last time the Fox News Poll asked in December 2014 . Then it was 58 percent repeal and 38 percent keep .  Meanwhile , a growing number expect another President Clinton . Sixty-five percent think she 'll win in November .

Moreover , his approval has been 48 percent or better since February .  Pollpourri  Trump 's video troubles and subsequent attacks on GOP leaders are hurting the party . One indication is more registered voters now consider themselves a Democrat than a Republican -- by nine points ( 44-35 percent ) , compared to by four points last week ( 41-37 percent ) .  Democrats usually hold an advantage over Republicans nationally in party identification , and this year self-identified Democrats have outnumbered self-identified Republicans by an average of three percentage points in Fox News polls .

Endorsing Trump is still a net positive for Congressional candidates : 27 percent of Republicans say they are more likely to vote for a Congressional candidate who refuses to endorse Trump , yet more -- 39 percent -- say they are less likely to do so .  No matter who wins , voters are concerned scandals will have a "" serious effect "" on the administration : 66 percent are worried about scandals in a Clinton administration and 63 percent if it 's Trump . More Democrats ( 54 percent ) are concerned about scandals in a Clinton White House than Republicans are about a Trump administration ( 41 percent ) .

Another , a former "" Apprentice "" contestant , said Trump grabbed her breast and kissed her aggressively in 2007 .  Kristin Anderson and Summer Zervos told their accounts separately .  Anderson , now a 46-year-old photographer living in California , told CNN 's Anderson Cooper that she was sitting with friends at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s when suddenly a man put his hand up her skirt . Moments afterward , she said she recognized the man to be Trump . The two had not spoken or met before the incident occurred , Anderson said .  She first made the allegations to The Washington Post , which reported her claim that Trump touched her vagina .  "" He just stuck his hand up my skirt . We just went off the rest of our night , "" Anderson said . "" I pushed him off and I moved away and I sort of did n't ponder it for that long ... He 's ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying yes , and more will come out . ""  When asked if she thought it was assault by Trump at the time , she said no .  "" No , I did n't think of it that way , no . But assault in my mind meant something else . Hitting is assault . I was very unaware of mental abuse , manipulation , bullying , that is just straight-up bullying . ""  "" Here 's a man who thinks he can do whatever he wants . And deny it . And get away with it , "" she added .  Zervos claims Trump kissed her twice on the lips during a lunch meeting in his New York City office . On a separate occasion in Beverly Hills , she alleges he kissed her aggressively and touched her breast .  She later pursued a job within the Trump Organization and says Trump asked her to stop calling him .  The former "" Apprentice "" contestant shared her story in a press conference that was organized by her lawyer Gloria Allred , a women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-profile sexual assault cases .  CNN has not yet independently verified Anderson or Zervos ' accounts . Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement Anderson 's account is a "" total fabrication . ""  "" It is illogical and nonsensical to think Donald Trump was alone in a nightclub in Manhattan and that the alleged incident and recognition of Mr. Trump went unnoticed by both the woman involved and anyone else in this ' crowded ' venue . ""  Hicks also questioned the timing of Anderson 's allegations .  "" Further , why is this just coming out now ? She described the allegation as being ' inconsequential at the time , ' but why then was n't it consequential when Mr. Trump announced for President , or when he won the primary , or when he headlined the convention -- why is it just now , three weeks before election day , consequential ? The answer is that this is clearly a political attack designed to tear down Mr. Trump . ""  Trump disputed Anderson 's claim at a rally on Friday , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing that he rarely sits alone , even though Anderson never claimed Trump was sitting alone at the time of the incident .  "" I was sitting alone by myself and then I went wah to somebody , "" Trump said , motioning to his side as he attempted to re-enact Anderson 's account of his behavior .  Trump later responded to Zervos in a statement Friday , saying he "" vaguely "" remembered her .  "" When Gloria Allred is given the same weighting on national television as the president of the United States , and unfounded accusations are treated as fact , with reporters throwing due diligence and fact-finding to the side in a rush to file their stories first , it 's evident that we truly are living in a broken system , "" Trump said .  The denial of Anderson 's claim is similar to ones the Trump campaign has offered this week as other women have come forward this week to accuse Trump of kissing or groping them without their consent . CNN has not independently verified any of these allegations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , emerged days after audio of a lewd conversation in which Trump bragged in 2005 about kissing and groping women surfaced last Friday . Trump apologized for the words , but insisted in the second presidential debate Sunday that he never sexually assaulted women in the way he boasted about on tape in 2005 .  The women who have leveled allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump this week have all said the publication of the 2005 tape and Trump 's denial in Sunday 's debate prompted them to come forward .  Anderson 's allegation is similar to the story of Jessica Leeds , who told Cooper -- as well as The New York Times in a story published Wednesday -- that Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt during a flight in the early 1980s .  Zervos said Trump "" grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me again very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast "" during an encounter in Beverly Hills , when she met with him in 2007 .  She continued , "" I pulled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then walked up , grabbed my hand , and then walked me into the bedroom . I walked out . He then turned me around and said , ' Let 's lay down and watch some telly telly . ' He put me in an embrace and I tried to push him away . I pushed his chest to put space between us . I said , ' Come on man get real ' ... He repeated my words back to me , ' Get real , ' as he began thrusting his genitals . ""  She was a former contestant of season 5 of "" The Apprentice "" and continued to see Trump as a "" possible mentor "" after she was "" fired "" from the show .  Trump denied these claims in his statement and said Zervos had contacted him as recently as April .  "" To be clear , I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago . That is not who I am as a person , and it is not how I 've conducted my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help , emailing my office on April 14th of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California , "" Trump said .  Later Friday , the Trump campaign released what it said was the April 14 email , in which Zervos purportedly writes that she is "" the only former Apprentice who operates a business where Mr. Trump 's supporters can walk in , express their admiration for him and inquire about my experience ... We hire a diverse crew and embrace anyone who is honest while working hard . Mr. Trump is cut from the same cloth . ""  The Trump campaign also released a statement from a man identifying himself as first cousin of Zervos . The man , John Barry of Mission Viejo , California , was quoted by the campaign as saying , "" Ever since she ( Zervos ) was on "" The Apprentice "" she has had nothing but glowing things to say about Mr. Trump "" and "" converted her friends and our family to become Trump supporters . ""  That was followed by a statement from Allred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" and a former employee at Zervos ' restaurant who has "" expressed hostility and ill will toward Summer . ""  Allred said also that three people corroborated that Zervos had told them in the past "" what she alleges Mr. Trump did to her . ""  The news conference was the first time Zervos has spoken to the press about her allegations against Trump . Allred said that she 's been contacted by more women accusing Trump of sexual advances .  "" Many more women have contacted me . Will they be coming forward ? I ca n't answer this question at this time , "" Allred said .  A People Magazine reporter wrote a story alleging Trump began kissing her without her consent in 2005 when the two were alone for an interview at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida . She was reporting an article on his one-year wedding anniversary to his wife , Melania .  Trump has forcefully denied all of these allegations and has argued that they are part of a conspiratorial effort to sink his campaign .  grunt  HILLARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Donald Trump brushed up against me 33 years ago to the day . I remember it like it was ..... well ..... 33 years ago . It made me feel dirty . I was just 26 . I was scared . That 's my story and I 'm sticking to it .

Trump , the Republican presidential nominee , and running-mate Mike Pence on the campaign trail Friday vowed to provide evidence to expose a series of claims over the past several days by women who say Trump made unwanted sexual advances in the past .  Late Friday , a Trump aide told Fox News that Trump and Pence , the governor of Indiana , were referring in part to a New York Post story in which a British man says he was on the cross-country flight during which Trump allegedly tried to grope Jessica Leeds and that the incident did n't occurred .  The 74-year-old Leeds said the incident occurred about three decades ago when she was a business woman working for a paper company .  The purported eyewitness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contacted the Trump campaign because he was "" incensed "" by her account , according to the newspaper .  "" I have only met this accuser once and frankly can not imagine why she is seeking to make out that Trump made sexual advances on her . Not only did he not do so ( and I was present at all times ) but it was she that was the one being flirtatious , "" Gilberthorpe said in a note provided to The Post by the Trump campaign .  Gilberthorpe also said he contacted the Trump campaign because he did n't like Leeds saying another passenger sat by while she was molested .  Leeds made the allegations on CNN and in The New York Times , to which Trump 's lawyers sent a letter demanding the newspaper retract and remove the story from its website .  A Trump aide also suggested to Fox News late Friday that the campaign will be looking to debunk more of the claims against Trump in the coming hours and days .  Leeds and several other women , including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in the past made unwanted sexual advances , in the aftermath of 2005 audiotape released earlier this month in which he can be heard bragging about having enough celebrity power to kiss and fondle a woman without invitation .  Trump said during a debate Sunday with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that he has never engaged in such behavior , calling the comments "" locker room "" talk .  At a rally Friday in North Carolina , Trump said the allegations against him are "" phony "" and "" 100 percent totally and completely fabricated . ""  "" I feel I have to talk about it because you have to dispute when somebody says something , "" continued the 70-year-old Trump , who also speculated the women are making the allegations for "" a little fame . ""  He also called the magazine writer , Natasha Stoynoff , a "" liar "" for allegation she made Wednesday in People that Trump tried to kiss her in 2005 at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida while she was on assignment .  Trump , a New York real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling for a boycott of the next People issue .  Earlier in the day , Pence said on CBS that the campaign , now trailing Clinton 's by rough 7 percentage points with Election Day about three weeks away , would be releasing information that "" calls into question these allegations . ""  The most recent allegation surfaced Friday , from a woman named Summer Zervos who says Trump kissed her and touched her breasts in a private room at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007 .  Zervos was a contestant on Trump 's reality TV show , "" The Apprentice . ""  The Trump campaign said in a statement that Zervos "" wishes she could still be on reality TV , and in an effort to get that back she 's saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump . ""  The campaign also said Zervos invited Trump to visit her restaurant earlier this year , in an attempt to discredit her allegations Friday .

Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin questioned the response of Republican candidate Donald Trump to the cyberattacks that hacked e-mails from John Podesta , campaign chairman for the Democratic candidate for the White House , that were then published by WikiLeaks last week .  In an article entitled "" What Did Trump Know , and When Did He Know It ? "" Caplin paraphrases the most famous line from the Watergate scandal and which referred to the stealing of information from the offices of the Democratic Party : "" What did the president know , and when did he know it ? ""  "" Four decades later , we 're witnessing another effort to steal private campaign documents in order to influence an election . Only this time , instead of filing cabinets , it 's people 's emails they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "" Caplin wrote on the Medium Web site .  The spokesman said there was no doubt that Russia was behind these hacking attacks .  The United States government has accused Russia of launching cyberattacks for the purpose of influencing the November presidential elections , and has charged it with hacking some 20,000 e-mails from the Democratic National Committee , or DNC , that were then published by WikiLeaks .  U.S. security and intelligence agencies have not reached the point of directly accusing Russia of stealing Podesta 's e-mails , but the Clinton spokesman said Saturday that the Barack Obama government suspects that the Russians are responsible for it .  Caplin said that Donald Trump was "" reportedly briefed in mid-August "" about Russia 's efforts to influence the American election .  "" In each case , Trump had reportedly already received intelligence briefings about Russia 's role in the hacks , but he apparently chose to ignore the evidence and defend Vladimir Putin , "" Caplin said , adding that Russian hackers and WikiLeaks are clearly trying to damage Hillary Clinton 's campaign .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounce Russian efforts to intervene in our election , "" he said .  "" Why is Trump protecting Putin by lying about Russia 's role in these hacks ? What did his campaign know and when did they know it ? Why wo n't he condemn this ? With less than a month until Election Day , these are the questions we need answered - and soon , "" Caplin said .

Donald Trump is bringing President Barack Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and final presidential debate , a campaign aide confirmed to CNN .  Hillary Clinton will be joined at Wednesday 's debate by two well-known billionaires who are backing her campaign , in what may be an attempt to rattle Republican nominee by su btly questioning his own net worth .  Meg Whitman , the Hewlett-Packard CEO and former Republican California gubernatorial candidate , and Mark Cuban , the outspoken billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks , will both be Clinton 's guests at Wednesday 's third and final presidential debate .  Meanwhile , Trump is countering with Obama 's half-brother and a ghost from Clinton 's past : Patricia Smith , the mother of Benghazi victim Sean Smith , who has accused the former secretary of state of "" murdering "" her son .  The New York Post first reported Trump 's invitation to Obama 's half-brother .  Whitman , a longtime Republican , endorsed Clinton earlier this year , saying in a statement that she would vote for and donate to Clinton .

She said she does n't know where she 's sitting yet , but she 's "" heard rumors "" that it 'll be the front row .  "" I would like to have Hillary tell me what happened , "" she told CNN .

Hillary Clinton did n't spout off any obviously canned phrases for "" Saturday Night Live "" to mock . But there were still plenty of fireworks during the third -- and final -- presidential debate of 2016 .  Here are the night 's top nine moments :  1 . "" Bad hombres ""  Trump , the Republican presidential nominee , raised eyebrows during his response to a question about border security . The content of his answer was n't surprising for anyone who 's listened to Trump since he began his run for the White House -- build a wall and deport the "" bad , bad people in this country . "" But near the end of the remarks , Trump suddenly used a slang Spanish word for "" men . ""  "" We have some bad hombres here and we 're gon na get them out , "" Trump said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and "" Bad Hombres "" was one of the top Twitter trends within minutes . The phrase had been tweeted out nearly 130,000 times by the time the debate ended .  Even Clinton 's digital team quickly jumped on the phrase , tweeting out "" Hombres "" ? #debatenight  2 . "" Open Borders ""  Moderator Chris Wallace pressed Clinton on a controversial remark she made during a paid speech to a Brazilian bank shortly after she ended her tenure as secretary of state . Clinton has resisted releasing the transcripts of her so-called "" Wall Street speeches "" despite pressure from her primary and general election opponents . Some of the transcripts , however , recently leaked out when WikiLeaks published a trove of stolen emails allegedly belonging to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta .  "" We 've learned from WikiLeaks that you said this , and I want to quote , ' my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders , ' "" Wallace asked .  Trump immediately leaned into his microphone and said "" Thank you . "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was talking about "" energy "" coming across borders , not illegal immigration .  Trump rolled his eyes and smirked at the explanation .  3 . Vladimir Putin  After the topics of WikiLeaks and the Podesta hack were broached , the discussion turned toward Russia , the nation many intelligence experts believe was behind the Podesta hacking . Clinton attacked Trump for being too cozy with Russian president Vladimir Putin and said Trump would be Putin 's "" puppet as president . ""  Trump responded : "" No puppet , no puppet . You 're the puppet . ""  After some crosstalk , Trump continued to counterpunch .  "" She does n't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her every step of the way , "" he said .  4 . Abortion and The Supreme Court  The next president might appoint as many as three Supreme Court justices , Wallace noted , a number that could influence whether the court leans left or right for an entire generation . The hot-button topic of abortion was discussed in this context , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation on the controversial procedure .  Trump responded with one of the most passionate -- and graphic -- answers he 'd given during any debate .  "" If you go with what Hillary is saying , in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby , "" Trump said . "" Now , you can say that that 's okay , and Hillary can say that that 's okay , but it 's not okay with me . ""  5 . Sexual misconduct allegations  Since lewd comments Trump made on a hot mic in 2005 were revealed two weeks ago , several women have come forward with claims that Trump sexually assaulted them . Trump denied all of the charges and accused Clinton "" and her very sleazy campaign "" of being behind the stories .  "" Well , first of all , those stories have been largely debunked , "" Trump said . "" Those people , I do n't know those people . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her campaign that did it . ""  Clinton responded : "" Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger . He goes after their dignity , their self-worth , and I do n't think there is a woman anywhere who does n't know what that feels like . ""  6 . Violence at rallies  Clinton lambasted Trump for being responsible for the rhetoric that she said provoked several violent incidents during his primary and general election rallies .  "" This is a pattern , a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence , where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies , "" Clinton said .  Trump , however , said it was Clinton who was guilty of starting the unrest . He cited an edited , undercover video released this week by a conservative activist . The footage allegedly shows Democrat operatives discussing how they have incited violence at Trump rallies .  "" So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tape . ""  7 . Clinton Foundation vs . Trump Foundation  Clinton and Trump traded shots about their respective namesake charity foundations , both of which have come under fire for various scandals .  When Clinton initially said she was "" thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation , "" Trump saw an opening .  "" It 's a criminal enterprise , "" he said . "" Saudi Arabia giving 25 million dollars . Qatar , all of these companies . You talk about women and women 's rights . So these are people that push gays off buildings . These are people that kill women and treat women horribly . And yet you take their money . So I 'd like to ask you right now why do n't you give back the money that you have taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly ? Why do n't you give back the money ? ""  Clinton retorted : "" And I 'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation , which took money from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton said . "" I mean , who does that ? ""  8 . Trump may not accept election results  Though he said during the first presidential debate that he would accept the results of November 's election whether he won or lost , Trump on Wednesday said he was n't so sure anymore . Trump has been frequently talking during rallies about his belief that the election is "" rigged . ""  "" I will look at it at the time , "" he said Wednesday night . "" I 'm not looking at anything now I will look at it at the time . What I 've seen is so bad . ""  Trump also said Clinton should n't be eligible to run for the presidency because of her secret server scandal . Though authorities said Clinton was careless , after a lengthy investigation the FBI declined to charge her .  "" She 's guilty of a very , very serious crime , "" Trump said . "" She should not be allowed to run ... What I 'm saying now is I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? ""  9 . Rigged  Following up on Trump 's talk of a "" rigged "" election , Clinton said the rhetoric was not only untrue , but also a tool commonly employed by the billionaire businessman .  "" Every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction , he claims whatever it is is rigged against him , "" she said . "" The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails . They concluded there was no case . He said that the FBI was rigged . He lost the Iowa caucus ; he lost the Wisconsin primary . He said the Republican primary was rigged against him . Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering . He claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him . There was even a time when he did n't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged . ""  After hearing Clinton 's comment about the Emmy 's , Trump interrupted : "" I should have @ @ @ @

Even when Hillary Clinton technically tells the truth , she is extremely deceptive . On Wednesday night 's debate , Hillary espoused the insane deception that President Obama has "" cut the deficit by two-thirds . "" This ridiculous claim has been touted by the Obama administration for years and is based on a complete fabrication .  Last week the White House confirmed a budget deficit for 2016 of $587B - a significant increase from last year 's $438B . After the $800+ billion stimulus , the massive omnibus spending bill and TARP , the deficit during the first Obama/Bush budget year was roughly $1.5 trillion . According to shady democrat economics , bringing the deficit down to $500B would be cutting it by two-thirds , if you only compare it to the highest year in history where it was massively inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton claims that she will not "" add a penny "" to the national debt , it can be safely assumed that she will be relying on the same fuzzy math to justify that outrageous claim .  Every election cycle , poll after poll indicates that the economy is the number one issue on the minds of the American people . If the economy is truly the most important issue on the table , it is clear who has been winning the debate between the two major presidential candidates .  Hillary Clinton has been using a very effective tactic during her campaign for the White House . Say something that sounds nice and hope it invokes emotion without people actually thinking about what was said . Free health care . Free college . Free puppies . Equal pay . A living wage . Social justice etc .  But what happens when you actually evaluate the rhetoric ? Who 's gon na pay for this ? How will it affect my job , my taxes , small businesses , the debt and the overall economy ?  Hillary Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal economic history as well as several "" feel good "" proposals of her own . The problem is that her attacks are inadvertent praise for Donald Trump . And rather than becoming defensive , Trump embraces many of the attacks as badges of honor and brilliantly replies , "" that 's the kind of thinking our country needs "" .  Democrats love to elect people who have never run a business or , in many cases , never even had a job . To be fair , Hillary Clinton once had a job defending child rapists which is one more job than current party leaders Obama and Sanders have had combined . But does that make her qualified to run the economy ?  Here are just some of the things Hillary Clinton has said during her campaign and the debates that best display her economic ignorance and make the case for Donald Trump as the most competent of the two to manage America 's economy .  Donald Trump stiffs contractors : There are numerous buildings , hotels , casinos and golf courses around the world with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because the people who are building them are not being paid . But Hillary uses the always annoying political anecdote . An exception to the rule disguised as commonplace . With thousands upon thousands of people who have done work for Donald Trump and presumably been paid , Hillary trots out one man who claims to have been stiffed by Mr. Trump .  Trump 's response : "" Maybe he did n't do a good job "" .  In the world Donald Trump lives in , the real world - people who do not perform a job they are being paid to do , do not get paid . In the world Hillary Clinton lives in , the government - people who do not perform a job they are being paid to do get a performance bonus , a raise and a hefty taxpayer-funded pension .  Equal pay : During the first presidential debate , Hillary Clinton actually attacked Donald Trump with the claim "" He has said that women do n't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men . ""  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person believes that someone should n't be paid equally unless they do as good a job as someone else ?  Trump 's taxes : Hillary claims that Trump 's reluctance to release his tax forms indicates that he is hiding something-perhaps the fact that he has not been paying taxes . And it appears as though she may be correct as Mr. Trump acknowledges that he uses the current tax codes to his fullest advantage .  The intent is to spark outrage among the American people that a billionaire has not been paying his "" fair share . "" The reality , is that the American voter will have to look in the mirror and ask themselves whether or not they would voluntarily pay more taxes than legally obligated to do .  Minimum-wage and profit sharing : Along with her constant demands for a "" living wage , "" Hillary Clinton believes that the government "" should incentivize "" corporate profit sharing .  Aside from convincing Democratic voters that everyone else is a racist , sexist , homophobic bigot , the greatest trick Democrats have ever pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value to society . But regardless of what American workers have been led to believe , you need your employer , they do n't need you .  Unless you possess a particularly invaluable and irreplaceable skill , you are easily replaced . With tens of millions of people out of the workforce , we do not currently have a shortage of workers . We have a shortage of employers . Does anyone actually believe that Hillary Clinton 's policies of higher taxes , an increased minimum wage , stricter regulations and profit sharing will incentivize startup businesses and growth of existing ones ?  Clinton continues to make promises to the worker while criticizing Donald Trump for incentivizing businesses and corporations with tax cuts and lower regulations . Perhaps this is a wise political move by Mrs. Clinton . There are a lot more workers than employers . But it 's important to remember that without employers , there are no workers . Without workers , you just go get more workers . To any worker who believes that they are entitled to so much more , always remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job .  It is possible that the rise of Trump was simply a rejection of the GOP establishment and "" politics as usual . "" Or it is possible that many Americans have decided that they want a CEO to run the economy . They want a cutthroat businessman who actually understands budgets , deadlines , payrolls and negotiations .  Donald Trump is an unknown , politically-speaking . But given the track record of our current political leaders , and if the economy truly is the top priority , maybe President Trump is worth a shot .

Since Oct. 7 , when a 2005 videotape surfaced of Trump making crude comments about women with former Access Hollywood ' ' host Billy Bush , several women have come forward to accuse the multimillionaire businessman of making unwelcome sexual advances .  Trump has denied all those claims , and said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women after the election .  In a statement released Saturday , the Trump campaign assailed the most recent accusations coming from Allred 's office , saying a photo produced at the news conference of Trump and Drake standing next to each other was no proof of impropriety .  This story is totally false and ridiculous , ' ' the statement said . The picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with Mr. Trump . Mr. Trump does not know this person , does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her .  The statement also slams the campaign of Trump 's presidential opponent , Hillary Clinton , insinuating it is the force behind the recent stream of similar allegations against Trump .  This is just another attempt by the Clinton campaign to defame a candidate who just today is number one in three different polls , ' ' the statement said . Anyone who would pay thugs to incite violence at a rally against American citizens , as was released on video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clinton campaign trying to rig the election . ' '

"" African-Americans are living in hell and are living -- in , in the inner cities , I mean , they 're living in hell . You walk to the store for a loaf of bread , you get shot , "" Trump said , raising his voice as he said the word "" shot . ""  But he made no mention of Martin , who was unarmed when he was shot by George Zimmerman after returning from a 7-Eleven store where he had just bought a pack of Skittles . Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges .  The line is one that Trump has used at dozens of rallies as he 's pitched himself to African-American voters , but could appear tone-deaf Trump delivered it here while at the same time failing to acknowledge the significance of his location .  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment , but in 2013 Trump said that he did n't disagree with Zimmerman 's acquittal , but that Zimmerman was "" no angel . ""  Martin 's fatal shooting in Sanford kicked up a national debate -- and reignited tensions -- on race in America . Addressing the shooting from the White House , President Barack Obama would later say that if he had a son , he would have looked like Martin .  Tuesday 's remarks came as Trump once again urged African-Americans to break with the Democratic Party and support him -- once again describing life as an African-American in America in desperate terms .  "" I say to the African-American community and to the Hispanic community , what the hell do you have to lose ? I will fix it . We will make them good . We will make them safe . We will bring back jobs . We will create good , good schools and education . I will fix it , "" Trump said .  Trump has previously faced criticism from African-American leaders and Democratic officials for his description of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not match the reality of the lives of most African-Americans , and for equating "" inner city "" life with the lives of minority citizens . Trump has also issued his pitch to black voters while addressing predominantly white audiences , though he has made three forays into predominantly black churches in Michigan and Ohio .  During one of those stops , at a church in Flint , Michigan , he was heckled and the church 's black pastor also cut him off as he launched into a political speech attacking his opponent Hillary Clinton .  His support among African-American voters remains in the single digits .

Especially if it seems too good to be true .  Why ? Look no further than Donald Trump 's Twitter account . Trump claimed Sunday morning that "" Twitter , Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton . ""  Not only was there no proof of this , but it was pretty easy to disprove . The FBI email inquiry was at the top of Google News ; FBI director James Comey 's name was at the top of Facebook 's "" trending "" box ; and Twitter 's "" moments "" section had a prominent story about the controversy .  Nevertheless , Trump 's wrong-headed "" burying "" claim was his most popular tweet of the day . About 25,000 accounts retweeted it and almost 50,000 "" liked "" it , helping the falsehood spread far and wide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one downside has been the spread of misinformation . Fake news has become a plague on the Web , especially on social networks like Facebook . As I said on Sunday 's "" Reliable Sources "" on CNN , unreliable sources about this election have become too numerous to count .  So that 's what I recommended a "" triple check before you share "" rule .  New web sites designed to trick and mislead people seem to pop up every single day . For their creators , the incentives are clear : more social shares mean more page views mean more ad dollars .  But the B.S. stories hurt the people who read and share them over and over again . Many of these fakes reinforce the views of conservative or liberal voters and insulate them from the truth . The stories prey on people who want to believe the worst about the opposition .  A recent BuzzFeed study of "" hyperpartisan Facebook pages "" found that these pages "" are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information . ""  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shared -- which does not bode well for the nation 's news literacy during a long , bitter election season .  "" Right-wing pages were more prone to sharing false or misleading information than left-wing pages , "" the BuzzFeed reporting team said .  On a few occasions , made-up or highly misleading stories have even snuck into Facebook 's "" trending "" box -- a problem that the company says it is trying to address .  In a few cases , Trump aides and family members have themselves been duped by fake news stories , including a hoax version of ABC News with a story headlined "" Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out : ' I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump 's Rally . ' ""  A close look at the web site reveals that it is not , in fact , the actual ABC News . But the site tricked Trump 's son Eric Trump in early October . "" Finally , the truth comes out , "" he tweeted , promoting a link to the bogus story .  As soon as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled my inbox with messages saying that CNN is the ultimate example of "" fake news . ""  But that 's a deliberate attempt to confuse the issue . Whatever faults CNN has , news organizations small and large try very hard to report the truth .  Fake news sites and Facebook feeds , on the other hand , traffic in misinformation . My sense is that there are three buckets of these sites :  #2 , Hyperpartisan sites that are n't lying , per se , but are misleading , because they only share good news about your political party and bad news about the other party ;  #3 , "" Hybrids "" that purposely mix a little bit of fact and then a lot of fiction .  These sites are n't going away , so it 's up to Internet users to spot fake news and avoid spreading it .  Fact-checking sites like Snopes can help -- they are devoted to ferreting out hoaxes and tricks .  Josh Stearns , a longtime media activist who now works at Democracy Fund , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fact checking has taken center stage in this election , but newsrooms need to go beyond fact checking politicians statements and help debunk viral misinformation too , "" he told me . "" At a time when trust in media is at an all time low , journalists should call out these fake news stories and help citizens tell fact from fiction . ""  Trump 's false claim about Google , Facebook and Twitter "" burying "" bad news about Clinton criticized what he called the "" very dishonest media . "" Ironically , he was using Twitter to blast Twitter .  Trump may have gotten the idea from an inaccurate Zero Hedge blog post alleging a "" social media blackout . "" The blog post contained false information . I asked the Trump campaign to provide a source for the wild claim , but no one has responded .
